      <p>
        Experience setting up GitHub: <br>
My experience of setting up GitHub began last year. It was needed for a group project exam. Therefore, I was unable to get a full rounded experience of it and have enough time to learn what it was all about. However, the urgent need for it made me adapt very quickly to some of the features that were required to transfer files and images such as the push and pull request. Although after watching the video on how to use it, I realised it was quite easy to engage with. 
<br>Reflections on the readings:<br>
‘As we may think’ by Bush:
I found this reading very interesting in its discussion of how science was introduced to a new way of thinking realising that it had only been used so far to increase the physicality of humans rather than increase the way our minds worked. It catered more to our physical needs than our mental needs. 
The more intriguing part of this reading however was that Bush spoke on things that did not exist when his paper was written but rather came to fruition in the future. Many of the ideas he discusses that would take science to another level of expanding our minds exist today. I think it is very important to note that because the people of his day were faced with exceeding amounts of knowledge but had no solid way of storing it and building upon it, Bush took it upon himself to generate futuristic ideas that ended up being solutions to this problem of not getting knowledge to the people that required it. 
‘The Library of Babel’ by Borges:
The library of Babel felt like a journey reading it. It took a new approach to explaining the concept of philosophical issues like the nature of the universe, meaning, reason, and infinite knowledge in a metaphorical way. It really makes one think how we function in a universe with an endless supply of knowledge. 
This reading is similar to the first in that they both address knowledge and how vastly filled our universe is with it. However, Borges’s reading shows us that our universe is filled with an insurmountable number of ideas that also have their own variations depending on the type of people, the culture and understanding, as well as the values of these individuals. For example, the idea of the colour red/meaning behind the colour red can have so many different meanings depending on the context and group of people. Therefore, showing us that every idea, every piece of knowledge, and every combination/variation of that idea/knowledge already exists within our universe. 
<br>My goals for this course:<br>
My goals for this course are to gain a deeper understanding of how the web works and use that knowledge to create websites and apps that deeply move as well as impact the users.

      <h2>Blog Post Week 2</h2>

      <p>My experience starting with HTML:
        <br>
        The topic of coding is associated with nervousness and being scared of failure for me. I have a fear of not being able to grasp the concepts of whatever coding language it is I am learning about which would lead me to falling behind as a result of my experience with C# last year. However, starting HTML has me confident that I have a good understanding of it so far and will grow in my knowledge of it as we continue to learn about it. I have come to realise that HTML is simple in that its concepts can be clearly understood but complex in that such simple concepts used together can create marvellous websites. 
       <br> Reflections on the readings:
        <br>
        ‘Why You Should Choose HTML5’ by B, Lawson:
        This reading was very informative about article and section. It explained very clearly the functions of article and section as well as why the first one is more preferable than the latter. Through this particular reading I have gained insight into how many components of HTML can be very similar at surface value but they most certainly are very different when you go beyond the surface. I think that it is important to realise that when choosing between similar components in HTML we should lean towards the one that will serve the purpose more effectively. The one that will benefit both the user and the designer(me) while also taking the website to the next level. The components that we choose should add value to our websites. 
        ‘How a Screen Reader User Accesses The Web’ by B, Lawson:
        The knowledge that I have gained from this makes me realise how shocking it is that I never questioned or thought about how people who have certain disabilities are able to access/use a website that is mostly catered to people, like myself, whose physicality is completely functional. Therefore, it is very helpful and interesting to hear from a person with a disability on how we as website designers can create websites that are usable to everyone. I think it is important to remember that anyone and everyone will eventually come across your website so it is your responsibility as the designer to make a website that is accessible but more significantly user-friendly to all people. Not only will this gain more users, but it will help improve your website in its usability. 
       <br> Reflection on Internet Histories:
        <br>
        It was mind-blowing to see how far back the internet started and realise that every idea that came to fruition enabled the internet to exist. It was also interesting to see that although every idea was an intellectual one, the next ‘thing’ to come out in the years that followed got increasingly better as well as more advanced. An important point for me was that as the internet and technology got more advanced, each creation was well-suited and adaptable for the time that it was made.

      <h2>Blog Post Week 3</h2>

      <p>
        My experience continuing the development of my website:
        <br>
It has been quite the journey as well as a significant learning curve for me. I planned out a beautiful and intricate wireframe for my website, therefore I was excited to get started. However, as I started bringing my idea to life with coding I ran into a few issues. The practicality of my design was just not there. It was pleasing to the eye, but the layout had no room to function. My solution to these problems was to look at examples of good websites and seek out the features, designs, and practicalities that made these websites great. 
<br>Reflection on the reading and lecture: 
<br>
The lecture for this week on the world wide web and interaction was knowledgeable. It was very interesting to learn how much of a significant role interaction plays in the world wide web as well as our own websites. It is the experience of the interaction on both sides that determine whether a website is considered good or not. If a website provides easy, accessible, and cohesive ways of interacting with it the user will very much enjoy their experience and time spent on it. However, if it is not then the user would rather leave the website than struggle to navigate it. 
Following through from my points above leads into how truly great a role UI and UX play in the design of a website. The reading explains how important making use of conventions are when creating, because it allows your users to understand what it is they are looking at and how to use it. I personally understand how difficult it is to keep yourself from adding new aspects to a website so that your personality may shine through it or so that it may tie into the ‘’theme’’ of your website but it is important to remember that new aspects an overwhelm the user as well as confuse them making the interaction difficult. Therefore, we should keep the users in mind when creating our websites. Our users are not with us when we are building our websites so if we surprise them with things that stray away from convention, we end up pushing them away from engaging with the website. For example, having the navigation bar at the top of the screen to the right is a convention that most websites use. Thus, we should have a similar setup to our websites. 
Mailloux mentions in his reading that conventions should also be applied to the appropriate context. For example, using the layout of Instagram for a website about a donut shop is not a convention that is appropriate for its context. However, using a layout that is common for food places/donut shops/cafes would be significantly more appropriate and related to its context. This shows us the huge role that convention and context play in creating a useable and readable website as well as how good use of UI and UX makes the user aware of what the website is showcasing and how to engage with it.

      <h2>Blog Post Week 4</h2>

      <p>
        My experience continuing the development of my website:
        <br>
I have a lot of different ideas about what I want the homepage of my website to look like and so I created a few wireframes that explore these ideas. I have so many ideas as I want to impress the user right from the point of entering my website since first impressions determine how your user will feel and experience the rest of the webpages. There is a lingering thought that I have about the website as a whole: I want my website to be cohesive and look like all the pages belong together so I may decide to use the same/similar layout throughout the website. However, I am considering using different background images for each page. Although, this might take away the cohesive design I was aiming for. 
How do my wireframes hold against the readings and lectures on UI: 
I have realised that some of my wireframes may be too complicated as they display beautiful layouts that I feel are out of my reach of achieving within my website especially since this is the first website I have ever created. I do realise that I need to make complete changes to some of my wireframes by simplifying them into something that I can create. The readings and lectures on UI truly emphasized the importance of the user and highlighted for me that the website should be designed to suit the user and their needs instead of parading my own desires and wants for the website. This is not to say that I will eradicate all my desires for the website but rather that I need to find a balance between incorporating my desires with the needs and interests of the user. 
After analysing my wireframes, I realised that they were not user-friendly at all. They were quite difficult and complicated. This realisation came after I did the reading on ‘The Basic Principles of User Interface Design’ which states that the UI should be easily interactable for the user. The user should not have to strive and work tediously to understand or get the website to work. When the user is using the website that engagement should be smooth like butter. It should require little to no effort from the user. My wireframes did not incorporate this concept and so they need to be changed. 
<br>How does the UI relate to interactivity:
<br>
Without good UI there will be no good interaction. Hence why the UI of a website needs to be functional in that it responds to the input that the user provides. It should also be easy to understand and navigate so that the user is not required to work hard to achieve the output that they desire. Therefore, UI and interactivity go hand in hand as the UI needs to be great for the interactivity to be great as well. 
<br>Reflection on the readings:
<br>
The reading that I did was eye-opening in its content on user interface. As mentioned above I did the reading on ‘The Basic Principles of User Interface Design’. It really assisted me in the understanding of UI and helped me in realising that my wireframes were too complicated for me to implement. The reading truly engraved into my mind and thinking process that when designing a website, we must create it for the intended audience as well as catering to their needs. It showed me that good UI would make the engagement effortless and enjoyable for the user. 
I believe that a website does not have to be a copy and paste of the layout that necessarily suits that content. For example, a profile website does not need to follow the normal layout. It can be created differently, but it must contain the aspects that make it a profile like including an ‘About Me’ page or a profile section that informs your users who you are and what it is that you do. It should also contain a page that showcases off some of the work that you have done.

      <h2>Blog Post Week 5</h2>

      <p>
        My experience continuing the development of my website:
        <br>
Last week I mentioned that I had quite a few ideas for the layout of my 
homepage. This week however I am glad to say that I decided on a simple design 
and the wireframing process was a great help in assisting me with my choice. 
I also stated that I wanted to use different background images for each webpage,
 but after much thought and deliberation I have decided to stick with one 
 background image throughout the whole website as it makes it more cohesive 
 and seamless. I believe that it will create this unity between the pages of 
 my website. Making use of one background throughout will also keep the 
 user’s attention on the content within the pages as they do not have to 
 adjust to seeing a new background every time they move to a new page. 
 This week I simplified my wireframes by completely changing the layouts 
 and design decisions as they were very much complicated for a first-time
  website.

      <h2>Blog Post Week 7</h2>

      <p>
        My experience continuing the development of my website:
        <br>
The process of creating my website has started to slow down this week due to other workloads I have had as well as personal life which I cannot really control. However, I am happy to say that I have a homepage that just needs to be styled and functional. All I have right now is the basic structure of it. It is quite a joyous experience seeing my ideas come to life and work in the way that I intended them too. I also have a ‘’theme’’ that I am going to be using throughout my website which I believe will really allow the user to meet me. By this I mean the ‘’theme’’ will convey a part of my personality and character. This ties in beautifully with the concept of creating a profile website as even some of my design choices will allow the user to get to know me. 
I am going to strive to work harder this week so that I may be able to get more work done on my website and hopefully my vision for the other pages will work smoothly with the homepage and each other. 
<br>IxD Process mashup lecture slides:<br>
The lecture slides were very informative on what is needed for the website. As mentioned above I was not able to work on my website as much as I would have liked too so most of the things mentioned in the slides I do not have. However, there are a few things like the design process, wireframing process, and goal alignment that I do have for each page in my website. I also have some of the information structure written down, but I still need to map it out. There may be a few things that I need to change so my website can accommodate the user and their needs. 
An important aspect that I need to update is the hierarchy of elements within the website. I need to move the most important aspects to the top of the page so that the user understands what is more important and less important on the website. However, I also want the structure of my homepage to follow the order that is present on the navigation bar as this will ensure that the user knows what is next when they are scrolling through the homepage. 
<br>Reflection on this week’s reading:<br>
This week’s reading explained meticulously that the user experience (UX) is more than the ‘’cognitive and task-orientated’’ and rather have roots that go deeper than that. It is about the emotional connection that forms between the user and website, the individual journey that the user goes on when traversing through your website. User experience cannot be centred around its usability/instrumentality because a user would not want to be engaging with something that has no meaning behind it. The UX of a website should be stimulating and satisfying an underlying human need such as the pursuit of knowledge or growing in their understanding of certain concepts. In our case, we are making a profile website, the underlying need would be to get to know who we are and what we are about from our website.
Therefore, we should put ourselves into the user’s shoes so that we may try to understand what their experience will be like when they engage with our websites.
