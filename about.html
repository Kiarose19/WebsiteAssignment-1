          Creating this website was an experience. It was a truly knowledge gaining, exciting, tiresome, and skill improving journey. 
          <br>
          The desire that I had for this website was to turn it into a piece of art that represented me as an individual.
          <br>
          I put a lot of thought into every detail of every page <br>from the miniscule details like the name of my website making use of alliteration to the big aspects like the pink flower themed bacakgrounds.
          <br>
          The goal that I wanted to achieve by using the flower themed backgrounds, <br> the pink and gold colours, and the logo of a woman holding flowers was to display a soft, kind and pretty feminine character. 
          <br>
          I personally love all things beautiful, romantic and soft like <br> flowers, books, the colour pink, warm cups of coffee on an icy cold winter night sitting by the fire. <br> Intrigued by majestic scenery like paris at night or Lake Como of Italy. <br> I would hope that my website therefore conveys my love for all things majestic and beautiful. 
          <br>
          May this website bring you a serene, peaceful and blissful journey as you traverse through it dear user.

              My name is Kiara Mohun and I am a digital artist at the University of the WitsWatersRand.<br> 
              My passion for art and creating started at a young age. It was a hobby for me that i greatly enjoyed. <br> I continued my creative journey going into high school by choosing visual arts as a subject that I took all the way through to matric. <br> 
              I was adventurous and decided to add design to the mix for a few months. 
              Finally I am at the point in my journey where I am studying digital arts.
               I chose this degree because I believed that it would give me the freedom 
               and opportunity to let my imagination run wild. It has been a very 
               fulfilling journey so far as it has been satisfying my hunger for 
               creativity and artistic expression.
